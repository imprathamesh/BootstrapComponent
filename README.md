Bootstrap Razor Components
Bootstrap Components is a simple and fast components for Blazor, with:

A clean and comfortable Blazor-native, with extensibility for custom html and css etc.
Strong performance when rendering in any Blazor hosting environment (Server, WebAssembly, .NET MAUI).
It is not intended to replace more full-featured, such as those from commercial component vendors.

This is experimental
Bootstrap Components doesn't ship as a supported part of Blazor or Bootstrap Framework. The purpose of this experimental package is:

To provide a reference architecture for a performant bootstrap component, which others may build on or copy.
To provide a convenient and reliable standalone free bootstrap component to Blazor developers who don't require to remember css of bootstrap.
Even though it is Open-Source, you are welcome to use it in production like other open source libraries from third parties.

You can take pull request and contribute.
